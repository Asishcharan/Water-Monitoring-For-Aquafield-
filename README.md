# Water-Monitoring-For-Aquafield-
I created a Water Monitoring system to assess pond water quality by detecting aquatic species and analyzing parameters like pH and oxygen levels. Using OpenCV and K-Means clustering for image-based pH detection and Pandas with SciPy for analysis, it recommends suitable fish species based on water conditions.
